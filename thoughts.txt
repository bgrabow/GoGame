Units
-----
1. Tk bindings - translates view model objects to Tk library calls
2. View model - keeps track of visible stones, grid, grid labels, in discrete board coordinates. This connects a visible Tk widget to a logical game component.
3. View - Translates geometry of view model into display coords and delegates to Tk bindings. Sends click events to View model.
4. Model - keeps track of logical game components, encodes their rules for interaction
